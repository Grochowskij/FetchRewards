# FetchApp
 Used Android Studio to create an app that reads a json file from the internet and groups the data by listId and then sorts by name

To run the application open it in android studio and connect an android device that has developer mode active, or use an android emulator. Then change the device to run on the device you would like. The content may take a bit to load.
